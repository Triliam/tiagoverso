    <p class="pContato">I swear I saw this guy the other day...
    <br>I was in my sitting in the park listening to a Britney Spears CD on my boombox when this guy walks past and says:
    <br> "When you're long gone, that song will live on." 
    <br>I thought it was cool that he liked my choice in music, but he was a little odd.</p>
